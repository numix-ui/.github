## 🎨 About Numix UI

**Numix UI** is a modern, lightweight, and themeable CSS UI framework inspired by the clean, elegant aesthetic of the original Numix desktop theme from the Linux world.

Our mission is to create a design system that blends the simplicity of flat design with a strong sense of visual hierarchy, accessibility, and developer ergonomics.
